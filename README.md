# MIP (Programming Environments and Tools)<br>2019 Project

## General information
This is an application realized using JavaFX for the "Programming Environments and Tools" subject project in my second university year at Transylvania University of Bra»ôov, Romania (2019).

## Purpose
The purpose was to realize a desktop application meant to handle most of the general functionalities needed into an university by a student, professor, secretary and administrator (ie. managing grades, seeing personal info, offering scholarships, etc.). For this project Java language was a requirement. We also needed to use a database provider in order to ensure persistency.
